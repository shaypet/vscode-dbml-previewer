- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper PropTypes or TypeScript types
- Handle loading and error states appropriately

### Git Workflow
- **Branches**: Create feature branches from `main`
- **Commits**: Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- **Pull Requests**: Keep PRs focused and small
- **History**: Squash commits before merging if needed

## 🧪 Testing

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# Run specific test file
npm test test/extension.test.js
```

### Writing Tests
- Write unit tests for utility functions
- Test React components with React Testing Library
- Include integration tests for critical workflows
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

### Test Structure
```javascript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // Setup code
  });

  it('should do something specific', () => {
    // Test implementation
    expect(result).toBe(expected);
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    // Cleanup code
  });
});
```
